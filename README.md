# Portfolio Website

This repository contains a minimal Laravel setup with a simple home page.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation) and its dependencies using Composer.
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the home page.

The home page view is located at `resources/views/home.blade.php` and the route is defined in `routes/web.php`.
